### Voter Migration at U.S. Presidential Elections 2016 and 2020

This project will be uploaded as soon as it has been graded as part of my summative assignments.

Methods used are:
- linear and logistics regression
- Classification trees, boosting, random forest
- K-Nearest-Neighbour

The models explain voter migration based on 60 demographic and economic variables and look specifically at the relationship between COVID-19 cases and Trump support.
