# Trump_2016_2020
Analysis of Voter Migration from the U.S. Presidential elections in 2016 and 2020

This project will be uploaded as soon as it has been graded as part of my summative assignments.

Methods used are:
- linear and logistics regression
- Classification trees, boosting, random forest
- K-Nearest-Neighbour

The models explain voter migration based on 60 demographic and economic variables and looks specifically at the relationship between COVID-19 cases and Trump support.
